## 2026-05-30 — Day 2: ingest pipeline

### What was built

**Phase 1 (design, Opus):** `docs/ingest-design.md` (266 lines) — full proposal
with function signatures, data carrier types, Postgres schema DDL, six key design
decisions, spec cross-references, and five open questions for the human.

**Phase 2 (implementation, Sonnet):** `src/rra/ingest.py` (348 lines) and
`tests/test_ingest.py` (334 lines).

Key functions in `ingest.py`:
- `download_guidances(limit)` + `_download_one` — httpx download with tenacity retry
- `parse_pdf(path)` — pypdf extraction + scanned-PDF detection (< 500 chars)
- `chunk_text(text, guidance_id)` → `list[Chunk]` — tiktoken sliding window
- `embed_chunks(chunks)` → `list[EmbeddedChunk]` — Voyage batches ≤ 128
- `_embed_batch(texts)` — tenacity-wrapped Voyage call
- `write_to_postgres(chunks)` + `_ensure_schema` — psycopg3 upsert, one txn/doc
- `main()` — argparse entry point; returns int exit code for CI use

18/18 tests pass; `uv run mypy src/rra/ingest.py` clean under strict mode.

### What was deferred and why

- **Natural boundary chunking** (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter): `langchain-text-splitters`
  is not a declared project dependency and isn't pulled in by `langchain-anthropic`.
  The tiktoken sliding window is used instead. Per spec §4.4, if recall@10 stalls
  below 0.75 the chunking strategy is the first lever to pull — that's when to
  either declare `langchain-text-splitters` as a dependency or implement the
  recursive splitter directly.

- **`download_guidances` for real**: the hardcoded `_CORPUS_URLS` list (8 URLs)
  has never been verified against the live FDA server. The actual download path
  is not covered by tests. See Open Questions #1 below.

- **Connection pooling**: `write_to_postgres` opens a fresh `psycopg.connect()`
  on every call (one per document). For the batch ingest job this is fine;
  the query path will need a shared pool. Noted but deferred — no `get_conn()`
  helper exists anywhere in `src/rra` yet.

### Decisions made unilaterally

1. **Tiktoken windowing instead of RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.** The design
   doc proposed langchain_core's splitter but that class lives in
   `langchain-text-splitters`, which isn't installed. The tiktoken window produces
   identical chunk sizes and overlaps; the only loss is structural-boundary
   preference. Added a comment in `chunk_text` pointing to the spec §4.4 reopen
   condition so the deviation is visible.

2. **All DDL in a single transaction with the data write.** The design doc showed
   `_ensure_schema` committing separately. Since all DDL is `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS`
   (idempotent), merging it into the document transaction simplifies the code
   without changing semantics.

3. **`_embed_batch` creates a new `voyageai.Client` per call.** Slightly
   inefficient, but a new connection on each retry is actually desirable. A
   module-level singleton would require the API key at import time, breaking
   tests that mock the key.

4. **PDF filename stem as `guidance_id`.** Used `path.stem` (e.g., `"72674"` for
   `72674.pdf`). See Open Question #2 for the readability tradeoff.

5. **8-URL hardcoded corpus, marked TODO.** Represents enough variety
   (SaMD, De Novo, 510k, design controls, software validation, cybersecurity)
   to bootstrap the retrieval eval. URLs have NOT been live-verified.

### Open questions to resolve next session

1. **Are the `_CORPUS_URLS` in `ingest.py` correct?** None were verified against
   the live FDA server (`https://www.fda.gov/media/{id}/download`). Before running
   ingest for real, check each URL returns a PDF (not a 404 or redirect to an HTML
   page). Add a `TODO(verify-urls)` search-and-fix pass to the Day 3 checklist.

2. **`guidance_id` = filename stem (e.g., `"72674"`) vs. human-readable title.**
   Numeric IDs are stable and collision-free but opaque in citations. A manifest
   file (`data/corpus/manifest.json`) mapping `id → {url, title, date}` would
   make citations readable without changing the schema — worth doing if you demo
   the system to a non-technical audience.

3. **psycopg directly vs. SQLAlchemy ORM.** The design doc flagged this.
   `write_to_postgres` uses psycopg3 directly for the bulk upsert. If the rest
   of the app (graph.py, MCP server) goes through SQLAlchemy Core/ORM, there may
   be a reason to standardize. No decision forced yet.

4. **Stale high-index rows on re-chunk.** If a re-run produces fewer chunks than
   the previous run (e.g., chunking strategy change), rows with high `chunk_index`
   values linger. The current upsert does not delete orphan rows. Accept or add a
   `DELETE ... WHERE guidance_id = %s` before the insert?

5. **`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` boundary preference.** Add
   `langchain-text-splitters` as a declared dependency and swap the chunker after
   baseline recall numbers are in hand (spec §4.4 trigger: recall@10 < 0.75).

### Commands blocked by hooks

None — no hook restrictions were encountered during this session.
